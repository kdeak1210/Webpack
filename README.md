# Webpack

## What is Webpack?
- Build tool that manages your code
- Starting at an entry point, builds a **Dependency Graph** that includes every module needed by the application, and packages them into just one or more bundles
  - Useful for managing dependencies of large, modular applications
- Able to 'minify' files for production
